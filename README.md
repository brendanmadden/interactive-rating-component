### Useful resources

- [Pixel to REM Converter](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter) - This is a great resource I use on most projects for any conversions I might need.
- [Jonas' JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) - This course in an unbelievable education in JavaScript and I would not have been able to build this project on my own without having taken it.
